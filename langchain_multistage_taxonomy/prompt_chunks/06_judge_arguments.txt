Task 6. Summarize each of the principal legal-environmental arguments made by the judge which support their ruling on this case, as inferred from the judge's written opinion. Please only include arguments where the judge uses first person pronouns, or makes any reference to “The Court” or “This Court”. Note that the judge will make at least one argument, and may make up to ten arguments. Please return all of the arguments made by the judge in the following format, with the number of rows corresponding to the number of judge arguments: 

"Judge asserts:
(1) [first judge argument summary here]
(2) [second judge argument summary here, if the judge makes more than one argument]
(3) [third judge argument summary here, if the judge makes more than two arguments]
…
"

Example: "Judge asserts:
(1) The plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate standing to bring this action, as they have not shown a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the defendants' conduct.
(2) The defendants' actions are protected by sovereign immunity, and the plaintiffs have not identified any statutory or constitutional provision that would waive this immunity.
(3) Even if the court had jurisdiction, the plaintiffs' claims fail on the merits because the defendants acted within their statutory authority."

Please provide only the judge arguments summary in the specified format.
