And thrive they have, a low, sprawling counterpoint to the gigantic alien-looking wind turbines that make up the Bear Creek Wind Farm at the very top of Bald Mountain in Bear Creek Township. A unique combination of the natural — and a view of technology that harnesses the natural to provide clean energy — greeted trekkers on a recent hike of Bald Mountain, a unique nature preserve."

But looking at the turbines even from a distance makes you realize just how massive these whirring sentinels are. Seventeen hardy souls took on the three-mile hike that was sponsored by the North Branch Land Trust, which is helping to keep Bald Mountain pristine by preserving a large tract of it."

The mountain also harbors a globally rare scrub oak barrens habitat that is invaluable to wildlife at local and landscape scales.\" So now, Lumia said, \"When you're driving on the Cross-Valley Expressway and you look up at the windmills, you know all that property below the windmills is protected.\""

Two state-designated \"high quality\" streams flow through the property, bordered by native hemlocks and aspens. And the trail abuts a large glacial bog that is home to several rare and carnivorous plants. Wildlife abounds, from the chattering of migratory songbirds — such as scarlet tanagers, Eastern towhees and hermit thrushes — to black bears, bald eagles and the red eft (salamander) that charmed folks on Sunday."
