Codebook:

Metadata:
* Information OTHER than the content of the article - such as title, date written, copyright, citations.
________________

Economy: 
* Discusses the impacts the windmills will have on the economy. This includes discussion about taxes, financial reasons, tourism, rising/falling energy costs affecting families etc. 
* Note: discussions of property value alone do not count for the economy code 
 
________________

Future and/or Character of the Community: 
* Discusses the concern the windmills would have on the community and what it means for the future 
* Note: Can overlap with scenic beauty but only when scenic beauty and aesthetics are explicitly mentioned. 
 
________________
Public  Health: 
* Discusses the impacts the turbines can have on their health, this includes discussing its dangers and how it relates to the public, light as a disturbance, and pollution. 
* Direct or indirect impact on somebody’s health (e.g. I can’t sleep because of XYZ).
* Note: This will often overlap with noise when noise is discussed in terms of impacts on human health and well-being (e.g ability to sleep). 
* Note: Will overlap with economy where health impacts have implications to them to perform their work 
 
________________

Infrastructure:  
* Discusses how the creation of the wind turbines would destroy roads/infrastructure (or build new roads that might destroy other things such as plants etc.) This can also include altering shipping channels/routes of commerce.


 
________________
 
Legality and Property Rights 
* Discuss the legality of the wind turbines. This includes any quotes about zoning, community codes, or property rights. This includes discussion of loss of ability or capacity to act freely on one’s property (see, e.g., quote starting with “Jan Murgittroyd,” below.
 
________________

Noise: 
* Discusses the noise of wind turbine construction or operation.
* Generally, this will overlap with public health. This means you can use both codes → except when noise is discussed without any reference to human health or well-being
 
________________
Partisan Parties: 
* Direct or indirect references to major party leaders or political parties in support/opposition to wind projects

* Must refer to specific concerns about aesthetic and beauty, and not vague concerns of quality or character of a place. (See future and/or character of the community code) 
 
________________


Sustainability and Climate Issues: 
* Discusses energy independence and or impacts on climate. This also includes any concern that standard or renewable energy sources might not be sufficient in guaranteeing energy supply.
* This also captures the link between wind turbines and reducing carbon emission and emphasizes the concepts of renewable energy 
* Discusses the impact of wind farms on sustainable practices and the environment (positively or negatively) 
* Includes concerns about reliability (e.g.: wind is unreliable)
* Discusses the impact of wind farms on Global Weather Patterns and impacts wind turbines have on the environment
