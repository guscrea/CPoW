The turbine caught fire Nov. 10, and firefighters were unable to access it because of falling debris. As a result, firefighters let the blaze burn itself out, sending a thick cloud of black smoke billowing over parts of the Wyoming Valley. Workers seen in the area this week are busy replacing the turbine, said Kelly Kimberly, spokeswoman for Dallas, Texas-based Leeward Renewable Energy, which owns the wind farm. \"We're in the process of completing the replacement,\" she said. Once the replacement is complete, crews will have to conduct testing prior to the turbine returning to service, she said. An estimated date of completion was not known. The wind farm on Bald Mountain consists of a dozen 256-foot tall turbines that generate about 75 million kilowatt- hours \u2014 enough energy to power 6,480 homes per year.

E. ON Climate and Renewables North America is rapidly updating its portfolio of projects, and it looks to expand into the counties with its Grizzly Bear Creek Wind Power Project. The company held one of many upcoming public consultations last Tuesday at the Elk\u00eds Hall in Vermilion. \"The benefit of these kinds of events is communication,\" said wildlife ecologist Stephen Glendinning. \"The public can find out who E. ON is. What do they want to do and why do they want to do it? And we're open to any feedback. We've certainly benefited from local feedback.\" The project would have up to 50 wind turbines erected within the counties. Although environmental studies will continue, enough has been accomplished since the beginning of 2011 to put together a proposed map of where the turbines will be constructed. \"The province is built on resource extraction. You have agriculture, oil and gas, and forestry, and wind is just another new form of that,\" said Glendinning. The project center is to be located approximately 6 km south of Mannville and 14 km southwest of Vermilion within Townships 48 and 49, ranges 7 and 8 (W4M). The size of the project is 120 megawatts, equaling 2.4 megawatts per turbine. With each proposed tower reaching 91 meters tall and having a 117 meter wide rotor diameter, many residents are concerned about the noise associated with large turbines. \"Noise is a concern, and dealing with noise has its issues,\" said Glendinning. \"But the laws regarding how much noise residents can be exposed to are more stringent in Alberta than in the other provinces. We have a lot less likelihood of issues.\" Wind energy projects must meet the Alberta Utilities Commission regulatory requirements for noise control. The two sources of noise associated with wind turbines are aerodynamic and mechanical, emanating from the rotating blades and the ground-level gearboxes, respectively. Glendinning says that so far there is nothing to worry about. \"You have to take into account the existing background noises, the existing facilities on the landscape, approved facilities that are not yet built, you do all then and then you add your project. We've done that. At the end of the day you cannot expose residents to levels beyond what the utilities commission deems.\" Another concern is the impact the turbines may have on the environment. \"We have to look at multi-seasonal wildlife issues,\" said Glendinning. \"You have to look at everything from bird migration to bat migration, what animals use the environment in the summer, what are the breeding bird species that use it, fall migrants, etc. You have to determine if any of those factors are going to be a concern.\" \"Other major considerations relate to archaeology and land-owner acceptance.

Although environmental studies will continue, enough has been accomplished since the beginning of 2011 to put together a proposed map of where the turbines will be constructed. \"The province is built on resource extraction. You have agriculture, oil and gas, and forestry, and wind is just another new form of that,\" said Glendinning. The project center is to be located approximately 6 km south of Mannville and 14 km southwest of Vermilion within Townships 48 and 49, ranges 7 and 8 (W4M). The size of the project is 120 megawatts, equaling 2.4 megawatts per turbine. With each proposed tower reaching 91 meters tall and having a 117 meter wide rotor diameter, many residents are concerned about the noise associated with large turbines. \"Noise is a concern, and dealing with noise has its issues,\" said Glendinning. \"But the laws regarding how much noise residents can be exposed to are more stringent in Alberta than in the other provinces. We have a lot less likelihood of issues.\" Wind energy projects must meet the Alberta Utilities Commission regulatory requirements for noise control. The two sources of noise associated with wind turbines are aerodynamic and mechanical, emanating from the rotating blades and the ground-level gearboxes, respectively. Glendinning says that so far there is nothing to worry about. \"You have to take into account the existing background noises, the existing facilities on the landscape, approved facilities that are not yet built, you do all then and then you add your project. We've done that. At the end of the day you cannot expose residents to levels beyond what the utilities commission deems.\" Another concern is the impact the turbines may have on the environment. \"We have to look at multi-seasonal wildlife issues,\" said Glendinning. \"You have to look at everything from bird migration to bat migration, what animals use the environment in the summer, what are the breeding bird species that use it, fall migrants, etc. You have to determine if any of those factors are going to be a concern.\" \"Other major considerations relate to archaeology and land-owner acceptance.

ON hopes that the benefits of wind power will help sell the project with landowners. The turbine project would create a cost-effective and environmentally friendly power source which would power almost 300 homes per megawatt. The project would also create temporary and permanent jobs in the area and generate considerable municipal tax revenues. E. ON plans to submit its application to the AUC during the third-quarter of 2013 and hopes the commission will reach a decision by the second-quarter of 2014. Public consultation will be ongoing and will continue through target construction phase targeted for the first-quarter of 2015.

The $200 million project involves construction of three new electrical substations and a 230-kilovolt power line, part of which will run through Luzerne County. Its purpose is to improve service and reduce outages for approximately 250,000 customers in Carbon, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Monroe, Pike and Wayne counties. PPL already solicited input at 13 public meetings. The PUC review process takes about a year, during which there will be opportunities for additional public input. The power line route represents the company's best effort to balance social, environmental and cost impacts while ensuring PPL can fulfill its obligation to provide reliable electric service, said Stephanie Raymond, PPL Electric Utilities Transmission and Substation vice president. \"We recognize that there is no perfect route for a power line,\" she said. \"That's why we are so diligent about seeking and listening to public input and making changes to the project - where we can - to address any concerns that may be raised.\" PPL Electric Utilities will construct about 57 miles of new 230-kilovolt power line from the Wilkes-Barre area to an area west of Hawley in Wayne County using steel poles averaging 145 feet in height. The new power line will connect the new electrical substations to the existing high-voltage grid, strengthening the local electric delivery network in a market that has been growing for decades and is expected to increase further. For the Luzerne County section of the project, the route will start at the PPL Electric Utilities Jenkins Substation in Plains Township and run parallel to an existing transmission line for about 2.4 miles in an easterly direction, crossing Interstate 81 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike. After crossing the turnpike, the route proceeds south for 4.6 miles, crossing Bald Mountain Road and passing around the eastern edge of the Bear Creek wind farm to intersect with an existing natural gas pipeline right-of-way. The power line route will then turn southeast for 7.7 miles, paralleling the north side of the pipeline, crossing sections of State Game Lands 91 and passing near a natural gas compressor station to end at a to-be-constructed West Pocono Substation in Buck Township.

Wind For wind farms, a hurricane can be too much for the turbines that produce the energy. David Smith, spokesman for Infigen Energy which co-owns and operates the Bear Creek Wind Farm, said its 12 turbines are designed to withstand the weather conditions and the company is taking precautions recommended by their manufacturer. \"They have a specific set point where if it's too windy, they'll stop. You don't want the wind over-speeding the generator,\" he said. \"The blades adjust to let the wind flow past them.\" The turbines are monitored around the clock from Infigen's Dallas, Texas, facility, and Smith said there are local personnel who live within 20 minutes of the Bear Creek site. The National Weather Service predicted winds with sustained speeds of 30 to 40 mph Monday into Tuesday, with gusts of up to 70 mph. Smith believes the Bear Creek turbines can withstand those wind levels, but it all depends on how long the gusts are sustained. \"We'll be watching the site, obviously, overnight, and we'll do any assessments if necessary in the morning,\" he said Monday afternoon.

Jones, his business partner Rich Adams and a friend were the only ones cycling along on the shoulders of roads every Saturday morning. Seven years later, the Saturday Morning Rides have grown to 30 to 60 cyclists who ride at an average pace of 14 mph. Jones, a co-owner of Around Town Bikes, said that the cycling season last 26 weeks - from April to October. The Saturday Morning Rides begin at 8 a.m. at Around Town Bikes on North Main Street in Wilkes-Barre. The group varies between two circuitous, round-trip routes: a north path that travels to Pittston and a south course that ventures to Nanticoke. \"Then we keep going different extended routes from there basically,\" Jones said. \"We get to the same point north or south pretty much the same every week.\" There are two different packs to accommodate the different fitness conditions among the riders. The more advanced group treks 35-to-40 miles, while the other flock bikes 25 miles. Jones said as the cycling season progresses, he chooses more challenging, hilly courses to Montage Mountain and the Bear Creek wind farm. \"It's nice to see their fitness improve over the course of the year,\" said Jones. \"We see some people who struggled with 25 miles at the beginning of the season. It's a real challenge for them. It's a sense of accomplishment for them that at the end of the 26 weeks when they could ride 40 miles and tackle some big hills.\" The Saturday Morning Ride was inspired by a similar store ride that Jones participated in when he previously lived in Southern California. Like its inspiration, it has emerged into a social event. After the two-hour bike rides, the group eats a light breakfast together inside the store, with many cyclists milling around and socializing for more than hour. \"We really know each other well in the bike shop and from riding a bike,\" said Bob Kelly, of Kingston. \"They come from all backgrounds - die-hards, college students, women, doctors, lawyers, professionals, and people from all walks of life. You learn about other people. It's a nice mix.\" Jones said the group ranges from teens to 70s with the 73-year old Kelly being the eldest member. Kelly, who fell in love with cycling when he briefly lived in London, said that Around Town Bikes' Saturday Morning Rides has rejuvenated his love of the sport. \"Look at me - I'm fit,\" said Kelly, who was a licensed coach for the U.S. Cycling Federation. \"I'm as old as Superman.

A June 2008 story in the Standard-Speaker stated the township received a stipend of $18,000 a year for the first 12 windmills. When approving plans for Phase II of the project, the township sought a $23,000 per year stipend. \"This was a very important project for us,\" Chiao said. \"We are trying to attract business and do what is right for our community and good for the environment.\" Locust Ridge is owned by Iberdola Renewable Energies USA, the world's largest owner and operator of renewable energy facilities.' Other wind farms have been the topic of municipal meetings throughout Schuylkill County. Questions regarding environmental issues like the harm to birds and bats as well as noise have come before local government officials. In Tremont and Hegins townships, there's been an on-going discussion among citizens about BP Wind Energy's plans to construct windmills and develop the Rausch Creek Wind Farm by 2012. The proposal would include erecting 50 to 60 wind turbines on approximately 2,000 acres in Hegins, Porter, Tremont, and Frailey townships. The Hegins Township supervisors addressed several issues concerning windmills during a March meeting. According to township solicitor David Rattigan, under the township's current zoning, the windmills would not be permitted on top of the mountain. He said the only permitted place in the township would be the land in the industrial zone and on Dell Road near the former Penn Reel. The township would receive about $6,900 per year, Rattigan said. \"The school district would be receiving more because their millage is much higher than ours. According to the figures, the school would be receiving approximately $58,200 per year.\" Broad Mountain Development Co. LLC, Gilberton, a Rich family company wanting to build 27 wind turbines in the Fountain Springs area on Rich and Girard Estate land in Butler Township, filed an appeal in Schuylkill County Court March 2 alleging that Butler's zoning ordinance improperly does not allow wind turbines, that amendments supposedly enacted on Feb. 1 by the supervisors do not cure the problem to its satisfaction and that state law March 15, 2010 | Standard-Speaker (Hazleton, PA) Author: LESLIE RICHARDSON; STAFF WRITER  Section: A  540 Words Page: 5 OpenURL Link thereby entitles it to build the turbines on its property. In February, Broad Mountain Wind Energy Center was notified they will receive $5 million in federal stimulus money to help construct 35 wind turbines, which will add 70 megawatts to the electrical grid generating system, as well as 100 local jobs. Once built, the project could have the potential to produce clean renewable electricity to about 21,000 homes, provide jobs and support local businesses. lrichardson@republicanherald.com Copyright, 2010, Standard-Speaker, All Rights Reserved.

Construction of the wind turbine farm began in 2005 and was finished in March 2006. Since then, the farm has been supplying energy when the wind blows. At 2,800 feet above sea level on 130 acres of land operated by Bluarc Management Group and Community Energy, Bear Creek Wind Farm has the capacity to create 24 megawatts of power each year, Todd Solliday, project manager, said. Bear Creek, he said, usually operates at 30 percent capacity until the winter months when winds are stronger and it runs near 70 percent capacity. The farm, Solliday said, creates enough energy to power about 7,200 homes for a year. All 12 Gamesa brand turbines that stand on Bald Mountain cost about $2 million each. In November, at turbine No. 8, wind pushed the massive blades, creating a dull \"whoosh\" sound. The wind was calculated to be blowing at 9 mph that day.

In one video, a turbine catches fire, engulfing the multi-million-dollar device in flames. Solliday said any time high-voltage electricity is involved there is always a possibility of fire, but wind farm companies do what they can to mitigate the risks. \"We don't want a $2 million turbine to burn down,\" Solliday said. Another video shows a turbine in Denmark exploding into pieces, scattering debris across the landscape. Solliday said the same thing happened a few years ago in Oklahoma. He said those instances usually occur after a technician overrides the turbine's braking system. He said automatic brakes are designed to stop the turbine if it begins to move too quickly to prevent explosion. Then there's the video of ice built up on the turbine's blades being flung from the massive devices. Solliday said the Bear Creek site already has been shut down and the turbines turned off until ice melts from the blades. He said ice buildup typically won't allow the rotor to move when the wind blows because of the ice weight. Also, Carlis said, wind farms are typically built far enough away from communities to prevent injury or damage to people and property. What about winged creatures getting caught in the turbines' blades? Carlis said wind power contributes to fewer bird fatalities than natural causes. He said a study showed turbines killed 75,000 birds in a year, while birds flying into windows contributed to between 100 million and 1 billion deaths and cats contributed to between 100 million and 500 million in a year. The benefits Electricity produced by the wind farms will offset the amount of emissions released by conventional generation, providing greener energy resources, Carlis said. There is no need for fuel, ash removal or water treatment chemicals at a wind farm, he said, creating a safer environment. Solliday said it costs less to operate a wind farm because less staff is needed than at a traditional energy plant. Power from Bear Creek is used by PPL Energy Group, a deregulated arm of PPL Utilities, Carlis said. PPL and the wind farm entered into a 20-year power-purchase agreement. PPL spokeswoman Lisette Santana said the company purchases between 52,000 and 59,000 megawatt-hours of energy from Bear Creek each year. It also purchases between 57,000 and 64,000 megawatt-hours of power annually from Locust Ridge, a 26 megawatt wind farm in Schuylkill County. The addition of wind farms as PPL's energy sources won't prevent electric rate increases but is an important part of how electricity is generated because it is emission-free, Santana said. About 10 percent of PPL's energy comes from renewable projects, such as wind farms, hydroelectric, bio-gas landfills and solar plants. Santana said turbines aren't reliable as a sole source of energy due to the wind being intermittent. When the wind isn't blowing, power isn't generated from turbines, she said. But as the years progress, she said, alternative energy will be improved and upgrades will be made to PPL infrastructure to create more efficient alternative-energy transmission. \"Everyone sees it on YouTube but it can be compared to shark attacks because it's so random and rare,\" Carlis said.

Wind farms, Carlis said, create jobs for turbine manufacturing in the United States. As the industry grows so will the number of jobs, Carlis said. People traveling for work on wind farms also use local hotels and patronize local businesses, he said. \"It creates a ripple effect in the host community,\" Carlis said. Officials' views Bear Creek Township Supervisors Chairman Gary M. Zingaretti wasn't on the board when the wind farm project was submitted to the township but he lives right next to the access road for the site. He said he can hear noise at his home from the turbines spinning. The closest one to his house is about two-thirds of a mile away. Zingaretti said people in other areas have said the turbines get very loud at times, but since he has been a supervisor for the past two years there have been very few complaints. The township recently amended its wind farm ordinance to prevent future wind farms from being built too close to homes, he said. He said all municipalities should have a wind turbine ordinance in place to protect the community and prevent environmental and safety concerns. He said when the news hit of a wind turbine farm there was a concern for safety, health and quality-of-life issues. Residents, Zingaretti said, should research the track record of a wind turbine developer interested in breaking ground in their hometown. Zingaretti said the Bear Creek developer made it known early on that they wanted to be \"a good neighbor\" and fixed problems residents complained about, such as water runoff. The township, he said, set up a contract with the developer and reaps a yearly per-turbine fee that started at $2,500 during the first year of operation. With inflation that number grew to the present-day per-turbine fee of $3,000 annually. Last year, Zingaretti said, the township received $36,000 in revenue for the turbines. \"It certainly helps financially to have that in the township. Obviously, that's $36,000 we don't have to get from our residents,\" he said. The few employees at the wind farm, he said, also contribute to tax revenue. Planning commission Vice Chairman Richard Kresge Jr., said there are pros and cons to wind farms. From an energy production standpoint and from an additional revenue source for municipalities, wind turbines are a benefit. However, he said there are those that argue the wind farm changed the character of the rural township by affecting aesthetics. He said in Bear Creek, it seemed once residents caught wind of the turbine project, they had questions and concerns for it but it was too far along in the development process to address some of them. He said residents should come to all public meetings held on wind farm developments early on and be informed of those meetings with ample time. Kresge recommended municipalities to ensure developers go through the proper subdivision and land development process in municipalities and to involve the public early on. \"If there's any recommendation I can give is go through the proper channels,\" he said. \"Go through planning, zoning and public participation. And then at the end of the day if they can demonstrate they can address the concerns of the township regulations I think it could be a positive thing,\" he said.
